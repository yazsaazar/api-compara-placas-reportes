# EditorConfig helps maintain consistent coding styles for multiple developers working on the same
# project across various editors and IDEs. The EditorConfig project consists of a file format for
# defining coding styles and a collection of text editor plugins that enable editors to read the
# file format and adhere to defined styles. EditorConfig files are easily readable and they work
# nicely with version control systems. https://editorconfig.org/
